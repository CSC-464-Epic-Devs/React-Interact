Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the 
standard markup language for documents designed 
to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted 
by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and 
scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web 
server or from local storage and render the documents 
into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure 
of a web page semantically and originally included cues 
for the appearance of the document.

<div style={{height: "100%", float: "right", width: "300px", margin: "auto 0"}}>
<htmllogo />
</div>

## Introduction

Let's say we have an HTML file like this:

React is a client-side framework. You can use it to make efficient graphical user interfaces. React is built on top of javascript, so a firm understanding of basic web (js, HTML, CSS) is typically desirable before delving into React, but not entirely required to begin.

A very basic setup for react works like this:

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>React App</title>
    <script
      src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"
      crossorigin
    ></script>

    <script
      src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"
      crossorigin
    ></script>
    <script src="http://fb.me/JSXTransformer-0.12.2.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="text/jsx">
      class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
        render() {
          return <h1>Hello {this.props.message}</h1>;
        }
      }

      ReactDOM.render(
        <HelloWorld message="ReactDom is an adapter attaching react to an html element." />,
        document.getElementById("root")
      );
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This HTML file is stand-alone, you can place this into a file called index.html and open it with your browser.

Let's go over a few of the dependencies listed in the head section.

- First is react itself, that's needed to call reacts API.

- The second script is fetching react-dom, this is what allows us to attach react to a given HTML element as shown with **ReactDom.render**.

- Then there is the JSX transformer, this is what will allow us to use JSX in our react script.

- The very last script tag is our actual react code and then binding it to our HTML element we gave the id 'root'.

### DO NOT BUILD REACT APPS LIKE THIS HOWEVER

You'll notice it takes a significant amount of time to render. This is because all of the libraries have to be fetched and this is not typically the way react apps are made. Also, the JSX converter is especially slow.

Typically you would serve a pre-built react app to your user with all libraries already loaded and the code minified. The one recommended by Facebook is [create react app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/).

### History

React was created by Jordan Walke, and its initial public release was May 29, 2013, with version (0.3.0).
Initially React was licensed under [Apache License 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License#Version_2.0), this changed over time, but currently React is licensed with the MIT License as shown on the [projects repository](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/LICENSE).
Facebook decided to make the change to the MIT license after getting negative public feedback on the previous licenses favoring the licensor over the licensee.

### Why should you learn it?

- People tend to like developing with React, [see for yourself](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks).

- React has a large community, not only is it supported by large companies such as Facebook. The react community also provides thousands of eyes on the open-source project. Some frameworks are designed to work with React because of its popularity. A few examples are:

  - [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
  - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)
  - [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)

- It makes your web app into a tree of reusable components saving you time in the future.

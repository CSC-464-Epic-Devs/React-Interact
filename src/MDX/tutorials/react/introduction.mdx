# Introduction to React



## What is React ?

React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library
for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community 
of individual developers and companies.

React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications,
as it is optimal for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded. 
However, fetching data is only the beginning of what happens on a web page, 
which is why complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries 
for state management, routing, and interaction with an API Redux, React Router and axios
are examples of such libraries. 


## History of React

React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, 
who released an early prototype of React called "FaxJS". He was influenced by XHP, 
an HTML component library for PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 
and later on Instagram in 2012. It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013.

React Native, which enables native Android, iOS, and UWP development with React, 
was announced at Facebook's React Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in March 2015.

On April 18, 2017, Facebook announced React Fiber, 
a new core algorithm of React library for building user interfaces. 
React Fiber was to become the foundation of any future improvements and 
feature development of the React library.

On September 26, 2017, React 16.0 was released to the public.

On February 16, 2019, React 16.8 was released to the public. 
The release introduced React Hooks.


## Why Should you Learn React

The main question arises in front of us is why one should use ReactJS. 
There are so many open-source platforms for making the front-end web application
development easier, like Angular. Let us take a quick look on the benefits of React
over other competitive technologies or frameworks. With the front-end world changing
on a daily basis, it’s hard to devote time to learning a new framework – especially
when that framework could ultimately become a dead end.

### Simplicity

ReactJS is just simpler to grasp right away. The component-based approach,
 well-defined lifecycle, and use of just plain JavaScript make React very simple to learn, 
build a professional web (and mobile applications), and support it.

### Easy to Learn

Anyone with a basic previous knowledge in programming can easily understand React 
while Angular 
and Ember are referred to as ‘Domain specific Language’, 
implying that it is difficult to learn them.
For react you just need basic knowledge of CSS and HTML.


### Native Approach

React can be used to create mobile applications (React Native).
And React is a diehard fan of reusability, meaning extensive code reusability is supported. 
So at the same time we can make IOS, Android and Web application.

### Data Binding

React uses one-way data binding and an application architecture called Flux controls 
the flow of data to components through one control point – the dispatcher. 
It's easier to debug self-contained components of large ReactJS apps.

### Performance

React does not offer any concept of a built-in container for dependency. 
You can use Browserify, Require JS, EcmaScript 6 modules which we can use via Babel,
ReactJS-di to inject dependencies automatically.

### Testability

ReactJS applications are super easy to test. React views can be treated as 
functions of the state, so we can manipulate with state we pass to the ReactJS view 
and take a look at the output and triggered actions, events, functions, etc.

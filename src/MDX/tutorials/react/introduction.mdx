# Introduction to React



## What is React ?

React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library
for building user interfaces. It was developed by a bunch of developers and is now 
maintained by Facebook. 

React is used in the single-page and mobile applications. Data that changes rapidly needs to be
fetched as it has to be displayed on the user interface. This is where React is handy as it 
is highly optimal in doing so. Complex react applications require libraries for state management and 
other fucntionalities. 


## History of React

React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook.
He was intrigued by XHP, which is  HTML library for PHP. It was used in Facebook's News Feed in 2011 
and on Instagram in 2012. It was later open-sourced in 2013. 

React Native is used for development of Android and iOS applications with React. 

On April 18, 2017, Facebook announced React Fiber, 
a new core algorithm of React library for building user interfaces. 

On September 26, 2017, React 16.0 was thrown open to public. 

On February 16, 2019, React 16.8 was thrown open to the public and in this version react hooks,
an important react concept was introduced. 

## Why Should you Learn React

The main question arises in front of us is why one should use ReactJS. 
There are many open-source user interface libraries already that are in use like Angular.

Let us take a quick look on the benefits of React

Front end world happens to change on a daily basis, and hence learning a new framework everytime 
is not worth it as it will eventually go out of use and be outdated. 

Below are the reasons why you should learn React 

### Simplicity

ReactJS is just easier  to learn right away. The component-based approach,
 and simple JavaScript make React very easy to learn, inorder to build  
 professional web and mobile applications, and support it later.

### Easy to Learn

Anyone with knowledge in programming can easily understand React.
For react you just need to know simple html and css. 

This makes it easier for someone with little knowledge to dive in and start learning 
React.

### Native Approach

React can be used to create mobile applications.
React encourages reusability, thus code reusability is supported. 
This helps in building mobile applications that are complex and large thus enabling 
React to be first choice for apps.

### Data Binding

one-way data binding is speciality of React. 
Data Flow to components is encouraged through a single point.   
Thus making it easier to debug React Components especially in large React applications.


### Testability

ReactJS  is  easy to test. React views are functions of the state, 
thus we can play around with state and take a look at the output. 

This helps in testing of functions and components. Thus making it 
React applications bug free and using React a favourable choice for 
developers for applications.

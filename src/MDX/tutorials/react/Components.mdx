# Components

Components are independent and reusable bits of code. 
They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, 
but work in isolation and returns HTML via a render function.

Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. 
They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and 
return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

#### In ReactJS, we have mainly two types of components. They are :

# Functional Components

In React, function components are a way to write components 
that only contain a render method and don't have their own state. 
They are simply JavaScript functions that may or may not receive data as parameters. 
We can create a function that takes props(properties) as input and returns 
what should be rendered. 
A valid functional component can be shown in the below example.

```React
    function WelcomeMessage(props) {  
      return <h1>Welcome to the , {props.name}</h1>;  
    }  
```

# Class Components
Class components are more complex than functional components. 
It requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render 
function which returns a React element. You can pass data from one class 
to other class components. You can create a class by defining a class that 
extends Component and has a render function. Valid class component is shown 
in the below example.

```React
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {  
      render() {  
        return (  
          <div>This is main component.</div>  
        );  
      }  
    }  
```
# Rendering a Component 

elements can also represent user-defined components:

```React
const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
```
When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, 
it passes JSX attributes to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”.

For example, this code renders “Hello, Sara” on the page:

```React
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

# Composing Components 

Components can refer to other components in their output. 
This lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail.
A button, a form, a dialog, a screen: in React apps, 
all those are commonly expressed as components.

For example, we can create an App component that renders Welcome many times:

```react

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome name="Sara" />
      <Welcome name="Cahal" />
      <Welcome name="Edite" />
    </div>
  );
}
);
```

# Component Constructor

If there is a constructor() function in your component, 
this function will be called when the component gets initiated.

The constructor function is where you initiate the component's properties.

In React, component properties should be kept in an object called state.

You will learn more about state later in this tutorial.

The constructor function is also where you honor the inheritance of the parent 
component by including the super() statement, 
which executes the parent component's constructor function, 
and your component has access to all the functions 
of the parent component (React.Component).

```React live = true
class Shirt extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { color: "blue" };
  }
  render() {
    return <h2>Thank you for buying {this.state.color}  Shirt!</h2>;
  }
  
}
```

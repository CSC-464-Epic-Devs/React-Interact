### Take a look at this code snippet:

```js
const snippet = <h1>Example<h1>
```

This is JSX, a syntax extension to JavaScript. It helps us define the UI for React Components.

Using this syntax, lets create some React code!!!

Try to edit this code:

```js live=true
function Example() {
  const sampleHeader = <h1>Edit Me</h1>;
  return <div>{sampleHeader}</div>;
}
```

### What is going on here?

```js
function Example() {...}
```

This is a React functional component. For now we can think of this as a way to create a UI block.

```js
const sampleHeader = <h1>Edit Me</h1>;
return <div>{sampleHeader}</div>;
```

In this snippet, we are storing the heading _Edit Me_ in a variable called **sampleHeader**.
The return statement takes **sampleHeader** and places it in the div block.

This is equivalent to:

```js live=true
function Example() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Edit Me</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# JSX

### Take a look at this code snippet:
```jsx
const snippet = <h1>Example<h1>
```

This is JSX, a syntax extension to JavaScript. It helps us define the UI for React Components.

Using this syntax, lets create some React code!!!

Try to edit this code:
```react live=true
function Example() {
    const sampleHeader = <h1>Edit Me</h1>;

    return <div>{sampleHeader}</div>
}
```
<Explanation header="What's going on here?">
    Temp Text
</Explanation>

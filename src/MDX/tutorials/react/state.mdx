# React State

React follows the [MVC](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mvc-design-pattern/) - (Model View Controller) design pattern.

Consider the following code snippet:

```js
class Toggle extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      on: false
    };
  }

  render() {
    return <button>{this.state.on}</button>;
  }
}
```

We have a React component called Toggle and it has a member variable called state which is a javascript object with one attribute: on, set to false by default.

Notice we can access our components state inside the render function. However, it is not very useful to have a static state, so how do we change that?

We can make a member function that will handle this click, but first we must bind it to this in the constructor.

```js live=true
class Toggle extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            on: false
        };
        this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
    }

    handleClick() {
        this.setState({on: !this.state.on})
    }

    render() {
        return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>{this.state.on.toString()}</button>
    }
}
```

Alright, so our button will call our handleClick function, and then what happens is it sets on to the opposite value of on toggling it.

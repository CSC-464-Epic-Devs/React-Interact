# React State

React follows the [MVC](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mvc-design-pattern/) - (Model View Controller) design pattern.

Consider the following code snippet:

```js
class Toggle extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      on: false
    };
  }

  render() {
    return <button>{this.state.on}</button>;
  }
}
```

We have a react component called Toggle and it has a member variable called state which is a javascript object with one attribute: on, set to false by default.

Notice we can access our components state inside the render function. However, it is not very useful to have a static state, so how do we change that?

We can make a member function that will handle this click, but first we must bind it to this in the constructor.

```react live=true
class Toggle extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            on: false
        };
        this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
    }

    handleClick() {
        this.setState({on: !this.state.on})
    }

    render() {
        return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>{this.state.on.toString()}</button>
    }
}
```

Alright, so our button will call our handleClick function, and then what happens is it sets on to the opposite value of on toggling it.

## setState is asynchronous

In the example above we only call setState once in handleClick, however if we were to call setState several times in rapid successtion, we may overwrite our current state with a previous state.

Consider this potential callback:

```js
handleClick() {
    this.setState({value: 1})
    this.setState({value: 2})
    this.setState({value: 3})
    this.setState({value: 4})
}
```

What is the value of this.state.value after handleClick is called? Answer: not determinable. setState is asynchronous, so it is unknown which queued calls will be executed first.

setState is asynchronous for optimization purposes.

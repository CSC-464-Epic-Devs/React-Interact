# Props

Props stand for "Properties." They are read-only elements. 
It is an object which stores the value of attributes of a tag 
and work similar to the HTML attributes. It gives a way to pass data 
from one component to other components. It is similar to function arguments. 
Props are passed to the component in the same way as arguments passed in a function.

Props are immutable so we cannot modify the props from inside the component. 
Inside the components, we can add attributes called props.
These attributes are available in the component 
as this.props and can be used to render dynamic data in our render method.

When you need  immutable data in the component, you have to add props to reactDom.render() 
method in the main.js file of your ReactJS project and used it inside the component 
in which you need. It can be explained in the below example.

### Example 

```js
const myelement = <Car brand="Ford" />;
```

The component receives the argument as a props object:

```js
class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>I am a {this.props.brand}!</h1>;
  }
}
```

# Pass Data 

Props are also how you pass data from one component to another, as parameters.


```React live=true
class Roommate extends React.Component {
 constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { Roommate : "Dustin Cook" };
 }


  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <h1>Who lives in my house apart from me?</h1>
        <h2>{this.state.Roommate}!</h2>
      </>
    );

  }
};
```

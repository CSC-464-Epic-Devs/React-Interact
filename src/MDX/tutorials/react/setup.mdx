# Set Up

On this page we will be go through the process of setting up the coding environment.

We recommend using VS Code as your code editor. <a style={{textDecorationLine: 'underline'}} href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Click Here</a>
to download VS Code.

<br/>

## Download NodeJS

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, 
JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for 
running scripts on the server-side to produce 
dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

## Command Line Setup

To make a new project execute the following statements in your command line.
If you use VS Code you will get a terminal inside the text editor itself.<br/><br/>

### Part 1 : Verify Installation

First check if NodeJS was successfully installed. To do so use the following commands.

&nbsp; 'node --version'

&nbsp; 'npm --version'

They should output the versions for Node.js and NPM.<br/><br/>


### Part 2 : Install Create-React-App

Now you can install your first node package with npm on the command line. 
You will install it globally with a -g flag. 
Because of installing it globally, you will always have access to it on the command line.

Type the following command to install create-react-app:

&nbsp; 'npm install -g create-react-app'

<br/>

### Part 3 : Make A New Project

To make a new project type the following command:

&nbsp; 'npm create-react-app project_name'

This will creat a new directory for the project. To navigate to this directory
and start the project type

&nbsp; 'cd project_name'

&nbsp; 'npm start'

The command line should give you an output where you can find the application in the browser. 
The default should be localhost:8000.

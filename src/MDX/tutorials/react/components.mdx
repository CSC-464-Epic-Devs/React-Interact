# Components
Components are blocks of code that are independent from each and could use again.
Their functionality is similar to that of JavaScript functions.
 They have a render function that returns html.
Compoents happen to accept props which we will talk about in 
later concepts as input and return React elements. These react elements
are the ones you would see on thescreen. 
#### In ReactJS, we have mainly two types of components. They are :
# Functional Components
Functional Components only contain a render method and do not have their own state. 
They are simply JavaScript functions that may or may not receive data as parameters. 
A valid functional component can be shown in the below example.
 It takes props as inputand renders content on the screen.
```js
    function WelcomeMessage(props) {  
      return <h1>Welcome to the , {props.name}</h1>;  
    }  
```

# Class Components
Class components tend to be complex. 
It needs to be extended from Component class and renders function to return
React element. 

Data can be passed around classes. 

Here is an example of a basic class component

```js
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {  
      render() {  
        return (  
          <div>This is main component.</div>  
        );  
      }  
    }  
```
# Rendering a Component 

Elements can also represent user-defined components:

```js
const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
```
If we have user-defined component, jsx attributes are passed to as single object
called "props". 

For example, this code renders “Hello, Sara” on the page:

```js
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

# Reusing Components

Components have the ability to use other components as well.

For example, we can create an App component below

```js

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome name="Sara" />
      <Welcome name="Cahal" />
      <Welcome name="Edite" />
    </div>
  );
}
);
```
In Above example, we reuse the **Welcome**  component and provide a prop *name*. 
Each **Welcome** component  output what is defined in them.

# Component Constructor

If there is a constructor() function in your component, 
we will have what we call Component Constructor. 

The constructor function initiates component's properties. 

In React, component properties should be kept in an object called state.
Parent Component is inherited using super() statement. 

The constructor function is place where there is inheritance of the parent component. 

It executes the parent component's constructor function below. 

```React live = true
class Shirt extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { color: "blue" };
  }
  render() {
    return <h2>Thank you for buying {this.state.color}  Shirt!</h2>;
  }
  
}
```

# React Components

Components in react are reusable bits of code. You can think of a component as a function that returns a piece of the UI.
They can be used to break apart a problem, and as a thing that you can write once and use again later.

We are going to start with two types of components: **class** and **functional**.

## Funciton Components

In the following example, we define a function called BigText, is has no parameters, and all it does is return some jsx.
This is a valid component.

```js live=true
function BigText() {
  return <h1>BIG TEXT</h1>;
}
```

## Class Component

React components can be done as classes like such,

```js live=true
class BasicComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Component results in h2</h2>;
  }
}
```

Notice how when we are extending **React.Component**, we need to define a **render** function; however, when we are just doing it functionally,
we can just return the jsx. We will get more into the advantages and disadvantages in the following tutorials.

## Component Composition

One of the primary purposes of components is in their composition.

<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tZZv5Z2Iz_s"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

While every component is independent, they can be combined to make something greater.

```js live=true noInline=true
const Header = () => {
  return <h2>Header</h2>;
};

const Body = () => {
  return (
    <p>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, falli blandit qualisque ei eam. Ne erant
      salutatus forensibus vis.
    </p>
  );
};

const Footer = () => {
  return <h3>Footer</h3>;
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <Body />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
};

render(<App />);
```

Notice how components here are getting broken down into jsx as primitives. A component must return
a single element (that is why we wrap the return in a div primitive), but you can feed the div any mix
of components that you would like.

## Higher Order Components

In javascript you can create higher order function like below,

```js
function multiply(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}

function mulByFive(x, multiplyRef) {
  return multiply(x, 5);
}

mulByFive(5);
```

**Output**

```react
25
```

Higher order components apply the same idea but to react components.

```js live=true noInline=true
function BigText() {
  return <h1>BIG TEXT</h1>;
}

function MakeItItalicToo(OtherComponent) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <i>
          <OtherComponent />
        </i>
      );
    }
  };
}

const MakeBigTextItalic = MakeItItalicToo(BigText);

render(<MakeBigTextItalic />);
```

## I have a lot of great content to give

Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas.


In the MDX folder, mdx files page locations on the site are directly tied to their path in the folder. 
So this example would be located at `http://localhost:8000/tutorials/helloworld`

At the very top of this example there is frontmatter for the mdx file. 
Frontmatter is metadata you put in the file that is used in page generation.
The title will be the page title.
The date will be placed right below the title and the
theme is used to determine the color scheme for the page. 
*There should only be one definition for the frontmatter and all fields are unique*

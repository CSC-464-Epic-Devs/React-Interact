# React Counter App Tutorial 


Let’s build a simple counter button in React that will update every time it is clicked.

To start, create a new React app called counter using create-react-app.

`$ npx create-react-app counter`

`$ cd counter`

`$ npm start`



Open your web browser to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the standard React welcome page. 
We only need to update the src/App.js file in this tutorial.

## Counter Component

Now we need to create our Counter component. First we can add it to App. 
Then create Counter and include a static button which will be set to 0.



```js
// src/App.js
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <Counter />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

class Counter extends Component {

  render() {
    return <button>0</button>;
  }
}

export default App;
```

If you go to http://localhost:3000/ you’ll see our static button now.


## Updating State

it is much more readable–and performant–to move this outside of render() to its own method called handleClick 
which is also an arrow function so that it only fires upon a button click. 
A nice feature of arrow functions is that this is implicitly set for us so we don’t also have to explicitly bind our function.

```js
// src/App.js
class Counter extends Component {
    constructor() {
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };

    this.handleClick = () => {
      this.setState(({ count }) => ({
        count: count + 1
      }));
    };
  };
  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>{this.state.count}</button>;
  }
}
```

As a final optimization we can use prevState which is built into React.
 It is a callback function that refers to the previous state and since setState()
  is asynchronous, using prevState ensures no errors around this timing.
  

```React live=true 
class Counter extends React.Component {
    constructor() {
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };

    this.handleClick = () => {
      this.setState(({ count }) => ({
        count: count + 1
      }));
    };
  };
  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>{this.state.count}</button>;
  }
}
```
